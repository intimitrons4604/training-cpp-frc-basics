# Motor Control Power Limit
In this exercise, you will write code to spin a motor forwards and backwards in teleop based on the deflection of a stick on the controller, but limit the maximum power of the motor.

## Advanced Note
If you want to make your code more concise, the `std::abs()` and `std::copysign()` functions may be of interest to you. They are declared in the `cmath` header which you can include with `#include <cmath>`. Their usage is not required to complete this exercise.

* [copysign function reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/copysign)
