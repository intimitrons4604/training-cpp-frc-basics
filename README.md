# FRC C++ Basics

This repository contains several exercises designed to introduce programming concepts and the WPILib suite, and provide context on how they may be used when programming an FRC robot in C++. It assumes a basic familiarity with programming and C++.

Every excecise is completely contained within its own folder. Exercises are intended to be completed in order. The folder names include a numerical prefix that indicates the order of the exercises, starting from 1. The folders that do not have a numerical prefix do not contain any exercises.

Each exercise has an accompanying `README.md` within its folder that describes the exercise and provides additional information. Portions of the code which require modification within an exercise are always marked with comments that start with `TODO` to facilitate easy location.
